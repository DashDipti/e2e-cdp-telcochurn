== Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to enable the easy and quick setup of the workshop.
Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) has been built from the ground up to support hybrid, multi-cloud data management in support of a Data Fabric architecture.
This workshop introduces CDP, with a focus on the data management capabilities that enable the Data Fabric and Data Lakehouse.

== Overview

xxxx from 

* Data ingestion & Data transformation/enrichment -- provided by *_Cloudera Data Flow (CDF)_* and *_Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)_*.
* Global data access and persistence -- provided by *_Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)_*.
* Data visualization with *_Cloudera Data Visualization_*.
* Machine Learning with *_Cloudera Machine Learning Visualization_*.

*_Cloudera DataFlow (CDF)_* offers a flow-based low-code development paradigm that aligns best with how developers design, develop, and test data distribution pipelines. With over 450+ connectors and processors across the ecosystem of hybrid cloud services—including data lakes, lakehouses, cloud warehouses, and on-premises sources—CDF-PC provides indiscriminate data distribution. These data distribution flows can then be version-controlled into a catalog where operators can self-serve deployments to different runtimes.

*_Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE)_* is the only cloud-native service purpose-built for enterprise data engineering teams. Building on Apache Spark, Data Engineering is an all-inclusive data engineering toolset that enables orchestration automation with Apache Airflow, advanced pipeline monitoring, visual troubleshooting, and comprehensive management tools to streamline ETL processes across enterprise analytics teams.

*_Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW)_* is a cloud service for creating self-service data warehouses and the underlying compute clusters for teams of business analysts. Data Warehouse is an auto-scaling, highly concurrent and cost effective analytics service that ingests high scale data anywhere, from structured, unstructured and edge sources. It supports hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure models by seamlessly moving workloads between on-premise and any cloud for reports, dashboards, ad-hoc and advanced analytics, including AI, with consistent security and governance.

*_CDP Data Visualization_* enables data engineers, business analysts, and data scientists explore data quickly and easily, collaborate, and share insights across the data lifecycle--from data ingest to data insights and beyond. Delivered natively as part of Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), Data Visualization delivers a consistent and easy to use data visualization experience with intuitive and accessible drag-and-drop dashboards and custom application creation.
